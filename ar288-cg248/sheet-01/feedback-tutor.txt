Hi Abderrahmen and Chandran,

here is my feedback for your submission of exercise sheet 01:

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 1: 8/10 Points

1. (1/2):
Your method works, that is good! But your call to:
    if record_id not in self.inverted_lists[word]:

Does not work in O(1), it is in O(n) since searching through an array needs to traverse
the full array until the element was found. Thus the complexity of your method in total is O(n^2)
which scales bad and surely is not linear time.
You already mentioned that the record ids are automatically sorted so you could just check the last
entry instead of searching the whole array, this would then yield O(1) and O(n) in total.
You need to improve that for the next exercise sheets else your code will be too slow
for later exercises (or use the master solution).

Besides that the method is fine, docs and test cases are also there.

2. (3/3):
Looks good, nice. However you missed a test case of the TIP-file (an important edge-case).
Usually that means zero points so don't miss that next time.

3. (3/3):
Again, nicely done.

But note that whenever you get "[]" because a keyword is not contained or if
an intersection yields "[]" as result then you can directly abort the whole loop with "break" as
the result will be "[]" in for sure.

However you are again missing some tests specified in the TIP-file.

4. (1/2):
Hmmm. You take some keywords and compute the result which is good but then you don't
output the result.
That means half of the points I guess. Why didn't you implement the last bit of the method?
If you had problems then please report back on the forum. We will help you fix those nasty issues.

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 2: 2/5 Points

You list some example queries but the explanation is very thin for the full points.

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 3: 5/5 Points

Yup, you are there. Neat!

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# General:

Overall well done. Make sure to not forget the test cases of the TIP-file again.

Total: 15/20 Points

Cheers
