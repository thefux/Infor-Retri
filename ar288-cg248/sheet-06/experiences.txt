Oop sorry that we forgot to remove the copyright the second time. It
won't happen again...

My web pages have the same format as in the lecture:
http://<host>:<port>/search.html?query=<query> rather than
http://<host>:<port>/search.html?q=<query>

Note: We used an internal style sheet for simplicity

As usual we spent a long long time on the exercise sheet, but we
managed to complete it this time. It is nice to do something
interactive with real data :-)

We are not going to upload the dataset because of it's space
requirements...
