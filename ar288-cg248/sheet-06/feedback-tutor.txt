Hi Abderrahmen and Chandran,

here is my feedback for your submission of exercise sheet 06:

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 1: 0/20 Points

1. (5/10):
	Though you serve 403 (forbidden), you also send the content of the file.
	So I am indeed able to see the file:
	https://i.imgur.com/XxFU3aU.jpg
	
	And also if the file is, for example, if type "txt" it will be "200" though
	located in a different folder:
	https://i.imgur.com/9NAkWpC.jpg
	
	Everything seems to be served as "text/html". Regular txt-files and CSS-files too.
	
	Besides that it works fine :)

2. (5/5):
	Splendid, works like a charm.

3. (4/5):
	Doesn't win a price but definitely fine! However it was part of the task to
	create a stylesheet-file that then is requested by the browser and served
	by your fileserver. So inline-css was not an option.

# General:

"We are not going to upload the dataset because of it's space requirements..." - And you're also
not supposed to, thanks! :)

Nicely done. Try to inspect your application next time more carefully and experiment with some inputs.
I think you could then easily have found out that it does not behave correctly for the highlighted cases.

Total: 14/20 Points

Cheers
