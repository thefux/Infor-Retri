We had problems in exercise 4:

When we compute 1 sided QGrams and work with those the formula from
slide 25 of the lecture we are not able to fulfill the third test
case. The equations from slide 22 comes much closer. I wish we had
more time to look into this problem...

I wanted to fill out the table before submitting my homework, but we
had to fill the table with "n.a.", because our homework has a lot of
code with quadratic and cubic run time.
