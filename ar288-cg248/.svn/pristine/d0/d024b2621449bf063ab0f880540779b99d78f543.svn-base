I had trouble debugging because I was not able to print anything from
my program whenever it got stuck. How can I make my program print when
it is stuck in a loop? Do I have to add something to the make file?

* with intersectZipper (with sentinels):
Average baseline time: 19937us.
Average intersect time: 14118us.

* with gallopingBinarySearch:
Average baseline time: 5045us.
Average intersect time: 6759us.
Bad runtime due to my crude way of avoiding the halting problem. Not
all the elements in the intersection are detected.

* with intersectBinarySearchRecursive:
stack overflow! This has something to do with the halting problem:

I don't have the time to deal with the halting problem before the
deadline.. :-/

* with intersectBinarySearchUsingSentinels:
gets stuck in the loop and doesn't print any output (maybe also
related to the halting problem).


Again I wish I had more time to work on this and I wish I hadn't
noticed that I had noticed these problems earlier. All the methods
pass the test cases just fine...
