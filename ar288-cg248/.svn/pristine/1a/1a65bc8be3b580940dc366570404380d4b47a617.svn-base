I had a problem in exercise 4:

When I compute 1 sided QGrams and work with those the formula from
slide 25 of the lecture I am not able to fulfill the third test
case. The equations from slide 22 comes much closer. I wish I had more
time to look into this problem...

I wanted to fill out the table before submitting my homework, but my
homework has a lot of code with quadratic and cubic run time...
