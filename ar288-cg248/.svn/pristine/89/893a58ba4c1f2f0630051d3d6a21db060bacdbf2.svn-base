There were some difficulties because one of us is new to python. Now
exercise 1 works well though :-)

We got the data set from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Exercise 2:

Each line has an ID, but some IDs/line nubmers are missing in this
data set. As a result, the line numbers from our code don't correspond
with the actual line numbers in the data set. In order to handle the
problem with the missing IDs, we reduced the length of the data set to
100 elements and inserted the missing line numbers...

Insights from my experiences:
The data sets are movie titles. Notice that movie description
(document length) is quite short with respect to the title's
length. Given that the title length makes up so much of the content,
it is important to optimize the search engine towards titles.

k:
When searching a title, it is important that as many key words as
possible occur in the title. This can be achieved with k = 0. Since
about 40% of the content is titles, we reduced k from 1.75 to 0.6 *
1.75 = 1.05

b:
As the titles and descriptions are quite short, a small difference in
document length is very significant. That's why b was increased from
0.75 to 0.75 * 1.4 = 1.05

This configuration gave very good results with the keywords that we
searched...
