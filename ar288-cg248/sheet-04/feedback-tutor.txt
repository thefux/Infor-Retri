Hi Abderrahmen and Chandran,

here is my feedback for your submission of exercise sheet 04:

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 1: 1/6 Points

Don't use "L_i" for the lagrangian since it is totally different to the "L_i" and "i" from the sum.

Why is "p_i = 2^(-L_i)"? You can't assume that since with that you fix the prefix-free code.
But the code is arbitrary, the only constraint is that Kraft's inequality holds and that all p_i sum up to 1.

Your missing a chooseable factor in your lagrangian notation. The "g" function should have "- c" in
the end for a "0 <= c <= 1" (the 1 comes from the "<= 1" constraint). And you need to choose that "c"
such that the result gets minimal (in the end). You directly choosed "-1" but you can not be
sure that this is the right choice of the range for c at this point.

The derivative with respect to Lambda is wrong. The sum stays since "lambda" is its factor.
You need to derivate with respect to "L_i", not "p_i". The "p_i" don't even occur in your constraint.

At this point your following transformations are wrong since your "base" is completly messed up.

All in all it seems that you have an idea of what to do but are not that clear about it.

Please take a look at the master solution to see the correct procedure.

# ______________________________________________________________________________
# Exercise 2: 2/8 Points

The exercise lists a different expression for "p_i". The expressions are of course equivalent but you
should not do that. It's also an indicator for me that you may have stolen the submission
somewhere from the internet.

Your totally missing the "ceil" and "floor" methods on your golomb definition. They are very important,
how would you use "2.5" bits? That is not possible.

Your length of Golomb is false. It is log_2(M) and not log_2(r), take a look at the lecture slides.

Why do you even use "x" when you have "L_i"? This way it is not clear who "x" and "i" should be, are they
different gaps? They should both be the same, so either write "L_x" and "x" or "L_i" and "i".

You need to use some logical symbols like "<=>" left to your expressions. Otherwise you just have a
bunch of expressions that are not connected to each other.

How can you absorb the "-1" from equation (21) to (22)? Have you proven that this holds, especially
together with the "%" operator? Is "5 % 2 = 1" less than "6 % 2 = 0"? I don't think so,
this equation is not true.

The same in the next line, how can you drop the left part of the "%" operator? This time it is
true but that is again not trivial. You need to convince more here. For example "x % y <= y" for all y
with fixed x since ... (plugin definition of % and show that it ranges to y).

Why is "i" constant? It is not, it is a gap which changes.

All in all I think you got the idea, good. However since you lack a lot of details, you made mistakes.
At that point it looks like your trying hard to construct your proof such that it concludes.

# General:

You have the right ideas but you need to practice writing everything more formal and precise.
If doing everything step by step you will see when you made a mistake.

Total: 3/20 Points
